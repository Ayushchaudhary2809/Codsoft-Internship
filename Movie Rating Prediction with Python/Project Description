Project Description: Movies Rating Prediction Using Python

This project aims to predict movie ratings based on various features using machine learning techniques in Python. The dataset used for this project consists of movies data from IMDb India.

Objective:
To develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the ratings of movies based on features such as genre, duration, and release year.

Dataset:
The dataset used is 'IMDb Movies India.csv', which includes information about movies such as:

Name
Genre
Year
Duration
Rating
Number of Votes
Steps Involved:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Import necessary libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
Load the dataset using pandas.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and content.
Clean the data by handling missing values and duplicates.
Feature engineering:
Extract relevant features and drop irrelevant ones.
Convert categorical data into numerical data using Label Encoding.
Normalize numerical features using MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler.
Handle and split the genre column to separate different genres into individual columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize data distributions using pie charts and histograms for both categorical and numerical features.
Analyze unique values and handle outliers in numerical columns.
Feature Selection and Splitting:

Identify target variable (Rating) and feature variables.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split from sklearn.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Train multiple regression models including:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Support Vector Regressor
Evaluate models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score (R²).
Model Comparison:

Compare the performance of different models based on MSE and R² scores.
Visualize the comparison using bar charts for better understanding.
Results:
The project concludes with the comparison of model performances, highlighting which model performs the best for predicting movie ratings. The evaluation metrics used are MSE and R-squared score, providing insights into the accuracy and reliability of each model.
