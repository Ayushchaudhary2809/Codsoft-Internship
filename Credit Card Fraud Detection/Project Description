Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify and prevent fraudulent activities by analyzing patterns in transaction data. The model is trained on historical credit card transaction data and aims to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. The model helps in minimizing financial losses and enhancing the security of credit card transactions.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for data processing and modeling.
Scikit-Learn: Library for machine learning algorithms.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment.
Key Contributions
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the credit card transaction dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features and created new ones to improve model performance.
Model Development: Implemented various Logistic Regression machine learning algorithm to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. Used cross-validation to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting.
Visualization: Created visualizations to explore data patterns, feature importance, and model performance.
