This project aims to predict sales based on advertising budgets using a Linear Regression model. The dataset contains data on the sales of a product in different markets along with the advertising budget spent on TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The goal is to build a predictive model that can forecast sales given the advertising spend in these three channels.This project aims to predict sales based on advertising budgets using a Linear Regression model.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

TV: Advertising budget spent on TV (in thousands of dollars).
Radio: Advertising budget spent on Radio (in thousands of dollars).
Newspaper: Advertising budget spent on Newspaper (in thousands of dollars).
Sales: Sales of the product (in thousands of units).
Project Structure
Data Exploration and Visualization:

Analyze the relationship between different advertising channels and sales.
Visualize the data using pair plots and heatmaps to understand correlations.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle any missing values in the dataset.
Scale the features to ensure uniformity.
Model Development:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a Linear Regression model to predict sales based on advertising budgets.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.
Compare the performance on training and testing datasets.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to predict sales for new advertising budgets.
